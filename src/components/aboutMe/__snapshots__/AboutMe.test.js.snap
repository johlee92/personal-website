    When I have free time, I can be found doing something active (e.g. hiking a 14er, surfing, swimming). I seek new adventures and enjoy having new experiences. I’m also an avid manga reader.

    I am currently based out of Denver. I’ve lived in Taipei, Philadelphia, New York City, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.
