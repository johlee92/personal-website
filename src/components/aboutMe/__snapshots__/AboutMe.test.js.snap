    I’m a web developer and an engineer by training. I enjoy working with a team to materialize an idea, to solve problems, and to improve efficiency. I love being challenged intellectually. 
    <br />
     
    <br />
    When I have free time, I can be found doing something active (e.g. hiking a 14er, surfing, swimming). I seek new adventures and enjoy having new experiences. I’m also an avid manga reader. 
    <br />

    I am currently based out of Denver, CO. I’ve lived in Philadelphia, New York City, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.
